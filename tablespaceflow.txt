File System Threshold: 80%
Tablespace Threshold : 84%
 
case 1 : do not add datafile --> for below tablespaces --> report to DB team
select tablespace_name, count(*) from dba_data_files group by tablespace_name having count(*) > 900 ;
 
 
case 2 : do not addd datafile if below percent is greater than 90% --- report to DB team
select round((select count(*) from dba_data_files )/(select value from v$parameter where name='db_files')*100,2) from dual;
 
 
case-3 : tablespace full - resize one datafile  --> take size to be added, change fs threshold,df threshold in resize df
            - resize multiple datafiles ( upto 30 gb max ) --> take size to be added, change fs threshold,df threshold in resize df(half)
			  - change(reduce) df threshold in std op if 96mb is to be added, df thres = 48.
            - add/resize only for 3 iterations
           
 
case-4 : tablespace full - add new datafile from existing mount point once if the datafile reaches 30G  
							--> chnge df threshold to 0 in resize std op
            - add new datafile from second mount point once if the first one crosses 80%  --> chnge 1st fs threshold in addf  //delete datafile in /data
				--> chnge df threshold to 0 in resize std op and make first mountpt more than 80% 
            - resize existing datafile till the FS reaches 80% and then add a new datafile from the other data related mount point
				--> make 1st fs to 79% and and change(reduce) df threshold in std op if 96mb is to be added, df thres = 48.
            - add/resize only for three iterations
 
case 5 : It must not proceed with the addition/resize and should throw a mail to DBA Team if any of the below cases observed by IGNIO-
            a. unable to bring tablespace to threshold(84%) within three iterations
			  -->change(reduce) df threshold in std op if 96mb is to be added, df thres = 10.
            b. more than 30GB to be added
            c. no space in one/multiple FS ( 20% free rule )
